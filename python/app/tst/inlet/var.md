The `${._key}` variable is the value of the key used for when all key and values are used ( `This list. actor` ).
The `This list actor` is for all the keys. The value is the list item of the key
The `This.rev list.S actor`, the items are reversed.
The `${._set.A}`, the value is the set item.
The `${._set}`, the value is the set dict.
The `${_.D}` is better than `${._var.D}` for some cases.

The `strs` function in gen.py`, replaces the variable names of a string with their values.
Some of the actor commands, calls this function for an item so that the item can be combined with variables.
This is not done for every item, and can be added if needed.
