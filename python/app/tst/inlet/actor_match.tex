Actor have a case like match on all the actors of the same name.
\texttt{Actor\ list\_act\ Node\ name\ =\ tb1}, here it matches the
varable \texttt{name} to \texttt{tb1} The \texttt{\&=} would be false if
the previous one failed. The \texttt{\textbar{}=} would be true if the
previous one was true. The variable has a \texttt{?} option like
\texttt{name\ ?=\ tb1}. This would fail if \texttt{name} does not exist.
In this case no error is printed and the global errors flag is not
updated - not seen as an error.
