The \texttt{\$\{.\_key\}} variable is the value of the key used for when
all key and values are used ( \texttt{This\ list.\ actor} ). The
\texttt{This\ list\ actor} is for all the keys. The value is the list
item of the key The \texttt{This.rev\ list.S\ actor}, the items are
reversed. The \texttt{\$\{.\_set.A\}}, the value is the set item. The
\texttt{\$\{.\_set\}}, the value is the set dict. The
\texttt{\$\{\_.D\}} is better than \texttt{\$\{.\_var.D\}} for some
cases.

The \texttt{strs} function in gen.py`, replaces the variable names of a
string with their values. Some of the actor commands, calls this
function for an item so that the item can be combined with variables.
This is not done for every item, and can be added if needed.
