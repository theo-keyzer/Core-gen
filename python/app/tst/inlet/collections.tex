These are to collect data for later use. They denormalizes the input to
be more elegant for the generator. The \texttt{Collect} and
\texttt{Hash}, store the current node's instance. The \texttt{Unique}
and \texttt{Group} store strings - does not duplicate. The \texttt{Hash}
can be accessed as a var \texttt{\$\{.Hash.A.Open.foo\}}, the others by
the \texttt{All} command.
