Explain how this system works

It seems this is a framework for generating code generators tailored to different schemas/domains. The key components appear to be:

    An input definition language (ini-style files) that allows defining nodes/components and their relationships. This serves as the schema for a domain.
    Templating actors that traverse the node graph and generate output code manipulating those structures. They have pattern matching and commands to navigate nodes.
    Underlying classes representing the nodes, with generated variables, relations and navigation methods from the input definitions.
    A runtime engine that handles executing the actors on the node data and outputting generated code.

So in summary, domain schemas are defined as node graphs, then actors use templating to traverse those structures and emit generated code. The output code has access to the node data via generated classes.

The underlying runtime engine seems fairly decoupled and customizable, while generated components can be regenerated without having to change core engine code.

This allows adapting the system to different domains without a lot of rewrite by just defining new schemas and actor templates.

Does this help summarize the high-level workings based on the documentation? Let me know if any part needs more clarification or elaboration.


Expand defining nodes/components and their relationships


Here is an expanded explanation of defining nodes/components and their relationships in this system:

The input definition language allows users to define custom schemas made up of nodes and relationships.

Nodes (called components) represent conceptual entities in a domain. For example, in a database schema, nodes could be tables, fields, relationships, or any other concepts meaningful to that structure.

Nodes have a name identifier and can have attached meta-properties defined as additional elements like type, documentation string, parent relationship, etc.

For example:

Copy code
Comp Table
  Element name (identifier)
  Element pad 
  Element value
  Element doc (documentation)

Relationships link nodes to model structural associations. Main relationship types:

    Parent - Direct parent node reference - connects nested components. Defined using "parent" element:

Copy code
Element parent R1 OtherNode

    Child - Inverse of parent link. Defined implicitly in child node.
    Local reference - Link within same parent context.

Copy code
Element link F1 OtherNode

    Global reference - Link independent of parent context.

Copy code
Element link R1 OtherNode

Additional link types model complex connections across hierarchy (L1, Q1).

Relationships enable:

    Tree-based structure to model containment/nested semantics
    Graph-based references express complex interconnections
    Key mechanism for node navigation and relationship queries

Together schema graphs made of nodes + relationships capture rich domain representations usable by the generator templates. The code generator leverages these structures to produce working code manipulating those concepts.

Let me know if any part needs more clarification or examples!

Expand on the Ref usage on where the reference goes to

Here is an expanded explanation of Ref usage and where reference links are expected to resolve to:

The Ref declarations provide additional semantic validation and documentation on the expected resolution targets for reference links declared in node definitions.

For example:

Copy code
Element link R1 OtherNode
Ref link OtherNode check

This states that the R1 link named "link" points to a node of type OtherNode.

Some key notes on Ref usage:

Targets:

The Ref target entity (OtherNode here) indicates the expected type for the reference link to resolve to. This serves both as in-code documentation and also runtime validation.

During loading, the framework checks Ref declarations to ensure references correctly resolve to the declared target component type.

Context:

Global refs (R1) should target a top level node marked with the Find property:

Copy code
Comp OtherNode
  Find

Local refs (F1) expect a peer node within same parent context marked FindIn:

Copy code
Comp Container
  FindIn
  
  Comp OtherNode
    FindIn

This allows validating that the reference targets are accessible from the referrer component based on scoping rules.

Cardinality:

Targets denoted with:

    . expect 0 or 1 link instance
    check expect 1 match instance
    ? treat as optional (no error on unresolved)

In summary, Ref statements allow better documenting, validating, and codifying the semantic contracts for reference links as expected by template developers and users of the generated code output.

Expand how the actors navigate these references

Here is an expanded explanation of how the actor templating language leverages the relationship references to navigate the defined schema:

Actors provide templating logic that traverses nodes and relationships to generate output code manipulating those entities. Actors utilize several commands to leverage refs:

Its - iterate child nodes based on parent-child or local/global references:

Copy code
Its OtherNode otherActor

This calls otherActor on each OtherNode instance related through a child or ref link.

Powerful for traversing graphs and tree structures via defined relations.

All - execute on all instances of global ref target type:

Copy code
All OtherNode otherActor

Does not require an explicit link - great for broad operations across components.

Du - Apply nested actor directly on current node itself:

Copy code
Du otherActor

Allow recursive exploration rooted at a start node.

${link_name} - Access linked node properties:

Copy code
${other_link.some_field}

Use declared refs to access or cross-link related data.

Chaining these together allows:

    Traversing nodes via links
    Recursing into components
    Accessing neighbor data

Building up relational data flows and transformations following the structure of the defined schema graph.

The validation and semantics provided by the reference declarations therefore underpins and enables efficient actor coding against the components.

Let me know if any part of how refs enable actor navigation needs more explanation!

Expand the 'Its'

Here is an expanded explanation of the Its command in the actor templating language:

The Its command iterates over related nodes by calling its specified child actor on each instance. This enables traversing the node graph structure by following relationships.

Syntax

Copy code
Its RelatedNodeName relatedActorName

Behavior

This will execute relatedActorName separately for every node instance that is related to the current node via either:

    A parent > child relationship
    An internal F1 link
    An external R1, L1 etc reference

Some key capabilities enabled by Its:

Recursion

Call Its on current node to recurse into itself:

Copy code
Its . recurseActor

Allows depth-first exploration rooted at starting node.

Tree Traversal

Iterate over nested child nodes:

Copy code
Its Child childActor

Works with components marked FindIn to traverse containment hierarchies.

Graph Traversal

Follow external references:

Copy code
Its OtherComponent otherActor

Lets you walk arbitrary graph structures by chasing links.

In essence, Its hands off processing to another actor for each node reachable through the schema graph providing workflows along both hierarchical and graph dimensions.

Chained Its calls achieve complex sequential data pipelines traversing arbitrary node landscapes, all following the domain schema connectivity defined via the relationship declarations.

Let me know if any aspect of the Its operation could use more clarification!

Expand how the actor match to separate paths

Here is an expanded explanation of how actors utilize matching to separate control flow across different node variants:

In addition to navigation, actors leverage pattern matching constructs to contextualize behavior to specific node types or properties. This facilitates modular code that customizes to variances in the schema graph.

Some core matching techniques:

Actor Name Matching

Multiple actors defined with the same name denote alternate logic branches. For example:

Copy code
Actor otherActor

Actor otherActor

When called, the actors are checked sequentially for a match until one succeeds.

This is useful for specialized sub-cases - each actor implements a variant.

Data Conditional Matching

Individual actors can define specific match conditions:

Copy code
Actor SomeNode
  match: value = X

The match clause filters invocation only to nodes meeting the criteria.

Conditions can leverage node properties or current state to identify qualifying items.

Chained Matching

Match clauses can chain together via boolean logic:

Copy code
match: prop = A 
   &= has X

This further narrows the filter - both conditions must pass to proceed.

Iteration Matching

The Its and All constructs incorporate iteration matching. An example:

Copy code
Its OtherNode[name = X] otherActor

This syntax applies actors only where the square bracket filter passes.

Combined these techniques enable specialized processing tuned to particular schema node types, configurations, attributes, hierarchies or any graph properties detectable in the structure.

When employed together, sophisticated conditional pathway logic emerges from the actor code following the contours of the underlying domain model.

Let me know if any aspect could use further explanation!

Expand on the actor 'Break' command

Here is an expanded explanation of the Break command in actors and how it controls flow:

The Break command is used within actors to alter looping control flow across actor invocation contexts. This allows early termination or continuation based on conditional checks.

There are several breakpoint variants:

Break cmd

Exits current actor's command sequence only. Later commands in same actor skipped.

Useful for early returns inside an actor body.

Break actor

Fully terminates processing of current actor. Control returns completely to caller.

Lets you short-circuit actor execution similar to an early return.

Break loop

Stops iteration of the current Its or All loop context only.

The enclosing actor continues executing commands after the loop.

This allows skipping peer nodes during graph walking sequences.

Some examples:

Copy code
Break cmd on_error   //exit if error state set

Its nodes breakActor //stop node set iteration 

All nodes[error] breakNodeActor //skip errored nodes

The effect bubbles up based on which looping scope handles the break command:

    Cmd sequence (innermost)
    Actor body
    Its/All iteration (outermost)

This enables flexible control over how much surrounding process should unwind on a break trigger at points anywhere deep in layered processing chains.

Let me know if any part of the breakpoint mechanism could use more clarification!

Expand on the 'Output delay' command

Here is an expanded explanation of the Out delay command and how it controls output buffering:

The Out delay directive enables buffering output lines to be emitted later conditionally, helping to avoid redundant or empty output.

How It Works

When Out delay is invoked, subsequent Cs/C print commands do NOT output immediately. Instead, their results are queued temporarily.

This delayed buffer persists until one of two events occurs:

    A later actor emits its first output. This "triggers" flushing the buffered queue to console.
    The end of the current iteration is reached without any trigger. Buffered contents are discarded.

Use Cases

Some examples where this helps:

Avoid empty output

Delay output from initial actor so empty prints avoided:

Copy code
Out delay 

Cs Optional print

Its next maybePrintActor

Only emit if next actor actually prints.

Conditional buffering

Surround risky prints with triggers to handle empty case:

Copy code
Out delay
Cs Preprint
Its . maybeTriggerActor 

Cs Postprint

Postprint only displays if trigger occurred.

Data-dependent gating

Control output based on item properties:

Copy code
Out delay

All items[error] 
  Its . errorHandlerActor //triggers if errors

Cs Format normal items

So output correlates with state from processing graph traversal.

In essence Out delay queues interim printer statements until later conditions indicate something rendered successfully, allowing better managing transient output.

Let me know if any aspect could use more clarification!

Expand the variable subsitution of the print comand

Here is an expanded explanation of the variable substitution capabilities used within the actor print commands:

The Cs/C print commands support embedding variable references that get dynamically substituted to output context-specific content.

Some core variable features:

Node fields - Access node instance properties:

Copy code
Cs ${name} has ${value}

Inserts name, value variables from current node scope.

Parent fields - Reference parent in containment hierarchies:

Copy code
Cs See parent ${parent.key}

Navigate into outer containing components.

Global fields - Cross-reference nodes globally:

Copy code
Cs Matches ${Table.main.key}

Table queries root tables dict to find match.

Computed values - Embed logic snippets:

Copy code
Cs Count ${.+ length}

Injects iterated set size directly into output.

Environmentals - external session/call values:

Copy code
Cs Arg is ${.arg}

Arg is argument passed from prior actor.

Together these mechanisms allow emitting dynamic textual output mixing:

    Local instance state
    Neighbor node properties
    Session/environment metadata
    Executable computations

Following relationships and state across the defined schema graph.

Advanced variable syntax also handles nested structs, methods, and filtered object sets when traversing complex graphs.

Let me know if any aspect of variables and print command substitution could use clarification!

Expand how errors are handled

Here is an expanded explanation of how errors are handled in this system:

The code generation framework incorporates multiple levels of error handling to surface issues during definition, loading, resolution, and execution phases.

Definition Errors

Syntax or semantic inaccuracies in the domain schema definition files generate immediate errors during initial loading.

For example:

    Invalid node names
    Missing required properties
    Circular parent hierarchies
    Bad reference targets

Caught and reported early before later stages.

Resolution Errors

During node data loading, linkage resolution warnings display for:

    Missing nodes on references
    Type mismatches to declared targets
    Link ambiguity/multiple matches

Notes runtime connectivity gaps in the final graph.

Execution Errors

As actors execute, run-time variable and property access errors manifest as:

    Unknown names
    Null values
    Method/execution failure

Emitted into output stream mixed with generation flow.

Custom Validation


Extensible hooks to implement domain constraints.

The different phases of validation, both built-in and custom, aim to surface inaccurate definitions, invalid data links, and faulty access patterns as early as possible - preventing downstream anomalies by tagging gaps close to source.
