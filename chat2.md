# Expandable System Code Generation DSL Specifications

## Startup

The DSL's initiation involves the processing of actor and def files. Actors, resembling traditional functions, utilize command line arguments stored in the starting node instance, facilitating dynamic customization during execution.

## Variables

Variables, denoted as `${name}`, support case conversions, enhancing flexibility. Special variables, prefixed by (.), serve distinct purposes, such as global scope management and comprehensive error tracking within the system.

## Actors

Actors, akin to functions with case-like statements, specialize in generating code tailored for data capture programs. Commands like Var, Collect, and Break contribute not only to data capture but also to the DSL's unique ability for self-code generation.

## Input

Input files, organized as word-based entities, empower the DSL to interpret and generate code specifically for data capture programs. The diverse range of data types includes Word, String, Ref, Local, Indirect, Multi, Nest, and Parent, offering a versatile approach to data representation.

## Window

Actor stack windows act as repositories, storing values and providing stack-based access. This functionality proves crucial in generating code snippets for data capture scenarios and plays a pivotal role in the DSL's self-code generation mechanism.

## Refs

Refs, categorized as R1, F1, L1, M1, play a central role in linking and navigating through nodes, contributing significantly to both data capture and self-code generation processes.

## Nest

Nodes can be nested through control fields, introducing a structured approach to generating hierarchical code for data capture scenarios. This nesting concept is intelligently harnessed in the DSL's self-code generation mechanism.

## Commands (e.g., Its)

Integral commands like Its serve as the backbone of actors, enabling matching conditions, loop control, and variable access. These commands dynamically contribute to code generation for data capture and support self-code generation.

## Code Output

Actors feature a code output command (e.g., C, Cs), allowing the dynamic generation of code snippets during DSL execution. This command proves versatile, catering to both data capture programs and the DSL's self-generation process.

## Self-Generation

The DSL boasts self-generation capabilities, dynamically producing its own code. This intrinsic feature simplifies customization and adaptation, making the system inherently expandable.

## System Expansion

The code snippets generated by the DSL are meticulously crafted to build an expandable system. The modular and structured nature of the generated code fosters seamless expansion, adapting to evolving requirements.

## Sample Unit File

A comprehensive sample unit file structure is provided, showcasing components, attributes, and references tailored explicitly for code generation in data capture scenarios. These elements contribute not only to data capture but also to the self-generation mechanism, fostering system expandability.

## Sample Def File

A sample def file structure is presented, exemplifying types, attributes, and conditions designed for generating code for data capture programs. This structure also supports self-generation, playing a pivotal role in the overall system expansion.

**Note**: This DSL stands as a specialized language, dynamically generating code for data capture applications while possessing the unique capability to generate its own code. This version emphasizes the DSL's potential to contribute significantly to the creation of an expandable system through the generation of modular and structured code.
