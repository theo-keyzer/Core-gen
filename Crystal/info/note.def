Model notes - map of note taking app
----------------------------------------------------------------

Frame 1

Frame 2 purpose - use cases

A idea    * list of ideas
A design  * some designs 
A todo    * todo items
A info    * data collected
A model   * build models
A story   * story follows a thought pattern
A pattern * need to guide the navigation through the model to create a story

Frame 2 mapping - how to join

A idea     * union of info, knowledge, skill
A wisdom   * how to act of the idea
A thinking * moving between the frame grids
A memory   * the path and result of the thinking
A learning * create new models by adding, reorder and refactoring other models
A design   * how to get from a to b

Frame 2 usage - how to use it

A capture  * collect new data for models
A match    * find correlations and missing links
A simulate * what the app needs to do
A doc      * describe the process

Frame 2 docs - making documentation

A find    * find relavant information in a document
A order   * order of doument
A flow    * detail need to flow together
A files   * bulk of data can be in separate files
A join    * process can join these files
A easy    * easy to re order
A subset  * needed subset of the document can be generated

Model model - define map of model
----------------------------------------------------------------

Frame 1

Frame 2 model - the model elements

A name * model name
A pad  * padding
A info * info

Frame 2 frame - the frame elements

A pos  * frame, n dim grid pos
A name * frame name
A pad  * padding
A info * info

Frame 2 a - the a elements

A model * ref to model
A pad   * padding
A info  * info

Frame 1

Frame 2 grid - the grid elements

A name * grid name
A pad  * padding
A info * info

Frame 2 column - the column elements

A name * grid name

A grid * ref to another grid
A pad  * padding
A info * info

Frame 2 row - the row elements

A grid  * ref to another grid
A file  * file name
A pad   * padding
A info  * info

----------------------------------------------------------------
Model match - map how to match
----------------------------------------------------------------

Frame 1

Frame 2 input - list of model names

A find * find the a's of these names
A join * join with the ref to other models
A end  * end if all the models are reached, print maps.

Frame 2 navigate - navigate the map

A each  * for each a, move to next grid
A join  * join that grid a's to other models
A get   * get shortest path to get to all the models
A print * print path, maps

Frame 1

Frame 2 gen - generate matching app

A build  * build actors to test use cases
A eval   * not enough data
A design * design app
A gen    * generate app

----------------------------------------------------------------
Model join - map how to join
----------------------------------------------------------------

Frame 1

Frame 2 find - the a of the items found

A its     * follow its ref
A ref     * the ref can be either to a model or a frame
A explore * that frame or model can be explore to get to the other item, or follow its a's refs
A frame   * move up to its frame and explore its ref and its a's ref
A expand  * move around in the model with up,down,left
A group   * items a related in some way within a group
