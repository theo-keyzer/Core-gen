The \texttt{All,\ Its\ and\ Du} commands, calls the \texttt{new\_act}
function to set up a new actor window on the stack. It passes the match
data \texttt{(variable,\ eq,\ value)} and \texttt{arg} string. The value
is evaluated from the current node instance. The \texttt{Du} command
calls \texttt{go\_act} with the current node instance, the others, the
generated code that call \texttt{go\_act}. The \texttt{go\_act} function
uses the new node instance. The match uses this instance and return if
the match failed. Then it loops through all actors with its given name.
Each of these actors, have there own match data and skips the ones that
do not match.
