It is data driven. The actors set the paths that the gen must follow,
but it is the input data that makes it go along a path. If the input
data is a maise, the actors would go down the available paths. There it
can collect or print data of that location, or choose to not go down
certain paths. The input has a location, but the actor also has a
location. The data printed is mainly from the actor's location. The
output goes to a file or get appended to a file. To build a system, lots
of actor are needed and a script to run them. These scripts are also
generated.
