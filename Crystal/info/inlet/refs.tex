The \texttt{R1} is a ref to another node, \texttt{F1}, ref to local
node, \texttt{L1}, ref to local node of the \texttt{R1}, M1, ref to
local node of an element of \texttt{R1} of a node that has a \texttt{L1}
ref.

The \texttt{Ref3} uses the \texttt{M1} field \texttt{from\_id}. The link
goes to node of type \texttt{Attr}. It uses the \texttt{attr} field to
get to \texttt{Attr} node. In that node it uses the \texttt{table} field
to be used as the parent \texttt{(Type)} to find the \texttt{Attr} in.
The \texttt{from\_id,\ attr} can be different node types. The refs run
in a sequence at \texttt{Element} level. First it does the
\texttt{F1,\ R1} ones, then the the \texttt{M1,\ L1} ones.

To use the links from the \texttt{Where} node, use
\texttt{attr,from\_id,id}. To use it from the \texttt{Attr} node, use
\texttt{Where\_attr,\ Where\_from\_id,\ Where\_id}. These are the
reverse links that loops to match. The \texttt{Its} cmd will get them
all, The variables will get the first one.

The \texttt{L1} is a simpler model of this, it uses the \texttt{R1}
instead of the \texttt{F1} to get to the parent. The \texttt{F1} share
the same parent. The \texttt{R1} finds the parent - top level nodes.

The \texttt{check} on the refs, means it is an error if it does find the
link. A \texttt{(.)} here, means it is optional link. The value then
also need to be a \texttt{(.)} if it is optional. If the value if
different, then it is an error if not found. A \texttt{(?)} here means
link if can, but no error if not.
