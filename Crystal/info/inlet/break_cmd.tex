The actor loop \texttt{go\_act} works like a \texttt{case} switch.
Actors of the same name, are the \texttt{when} cases. The command loop
\texttt{go\_cmds}, loops through the commands in that actor. The
\texttt{All,\ Its} loop, calls the \texttt{go\_act} function in a loop.
The \texttt{Du} command call another actor with \texttt{go\_act}. To
break out of the \texttt{go\_cmds}'s loop, it uses a break to end the
loop. The \texttt{Break\ cmd} command and \texttt{Unique} does that. To
break out of the actor loop, it returns 2. The \texttt{Break\ actor}
does that. That ends up in the \texttt{go\_act}, that end it. To break
out of the \texttt{Its,\ All} loop, it returns 1. The
\texttt{Break\ loop} command does that. The actor loop \texttt{go\_act}
would return 1 if its return is 1. The return 1 will end up in the
calling \texttt{Its,\ All} command that will continue with the
\texttt{go\_cmds}. The generated code loop functions would return the
result if \texttt{!=\ 0}. The other implementations make use of a depth
value that gets inc/dec. It can go back further. The problem is the
\texttt{Du} command \texttt{Do/Jump} that may or may not be between the
loops.
