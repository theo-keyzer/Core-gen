This creates a named entry in the the current node's instance. The
\texttt{Var\ foo\ =\ bar}, sets the variable. To access it,
\texttt{\$\{foo\}} The \texttt{Var\ .list\_act.foo\ =\ abar}, set the
variable in the node instance that is current in the \texttt{list\_act}.
The current actors are on the stack. To access it,
\texttt{\$\{.list\_act.foo\}}, or when on that node instance (back to
the list\_act), \texttt{\$\{foo\}}.

Also has a \texttt{regex} that can break down the string as named
entries.
