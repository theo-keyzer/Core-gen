The `${name} ` gets replaced by the value of the variable `name`. To escape the `${`, use `$${`
The case conversion letter `c` like `${name}c`, captilize the variable's value.
The `${.arg}` is the value of the argument passed from the previous actor.
The `${eval}$`, it replaces the eval with the `strs` function of the value of `eval`.
That is to get a code block from a separate file and print it `C ${code_block}$`.
