The generator takes a \texttt{,} separated list of actor files followed
by a \texttt{,} separated list of def input files. They each are all
lumped together.

The first actor's name, is the starting actor. The \texttt{go\_act}
function loop through all actors with this name.

All comand line arguments are store in the starting node instance as
named entries. They are \texttt{\$\{0\},\ \$\{1\}} variables. To access
these variables else where, prefix it with the starting actor's name
like \texttt{\$\{.main.1\}}.
