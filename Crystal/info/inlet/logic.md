The actors are limited in program logic.
The engine is more suited to deal and solve 
these demands. The more expressive the actors
become, the more complicated the engine
becomes to program to deal and solve these demands.
While building a system, the actors becomes the source code.
Having both the target and the actor language mixed is blurry.
They need to be separated like forground and background.
