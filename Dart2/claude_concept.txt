Documentation Generation Script
Overview
This script generates multi-format documentation from a structured input, allowing for flexible, user-defined document creation with intelligent content sharing and linking.
Key Components

Input Structure
Topic Processing
Concept Handling
Content Sharing Mechanisms
External File Integration
Multi-format Output Generation
User Customization

Detailed Functionality
1. Input Structure

The input consists of Concepts, which contain multiple Topics.
Each Topic has a name and contains content items (T).
Special Topic names:

"." for content shared across all Topics in a Concept
"_" for content shared at the same section level within a Concept



2. Topic Processing

Topics with the same name are aggregated into a single output document.
Content from Topics is organized based on their originating Concepts and order in the input.

3. Concept Handling

Concepts describe relationships between multiple Topics.
They serve as a framework for contextualizing and connecting various Topics.

4. Content Sharing Mechanisms

(.) content: Shared across all Topics within a Concept.
(_) content: Shared only by Topics at the same section level within a Concept.

5. External File Integration

Topic items (T) can include references to external files (examples, text blocks).
The script allows optional inclusion of these external files in the generated documents.

6. Multi-format Output Generation

Supports output in HTML, Markdown, LaTeX, and PDF formats.
Ensures consistency across different output formats.

7. User Customization

Users can combine multiple Topics into a single custom document.
Allows for creation of focused, relevant documentation without unnecessary information.

Document Generation Process

Parse input structure (Concepts, Topics, content items).
Process Topics:

Aggregate Topics with the same name.
Apply content sharing rules (. and _).
Integrate external files if specified.


Generate links:

Create links to Topics not included in the current document.
Avoid internal links for combined Topics in custom documents.


Apply user customization:

Combine user-specified Topics into custom documents.


Generate output:

Create documents in specified format(s) (HTML, Markdown, LaTeX, PDF).



Key Features

Flexible document creation based on Topics rather than Concepts.
Intelligent content sharing at Concept and section levels.
Customizable document generation for user-specific needs.
Multi-format output for diverse use cases.
External file integration for modular content management.
Efficient linking system that adapts to custom document creation.

This script provides a powerful and flexible system for creating documentation that can be easily customized and maintained while preserving the complex relationships between different pieces of information.
